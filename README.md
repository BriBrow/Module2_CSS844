# Module2_CSS844
For Group 3 of Module 2 in CSS844 at MSU - Spring 2022

Note: The R code starts with raw data:
- `2020 Potato Late Blight Trial RAUDPC 20220224.xlsx`
- `plotwise_values_new.csv`
- `VNIR Band Name and range.xlsx`

The file `CombinedPotatoData.csv` contains formatted data that can be used to run some code. It doesn't include the vnir data, as that is added in the `MakeLong` function.
