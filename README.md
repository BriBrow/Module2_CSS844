# Module2_CSS844
For Group 3 of Module 2 in CSS844 at MSU - Spring 2022

Note: The R code starts with raw data:
- `2020 Potato Late Blight Trial RAUDPC 20220224.xlsx`
- `plotwise_values_new.csv`
- `VNIR Band Name and range.xlsx`

The file `CombinedPotatoData.csv` contains formatted data from `2020 Potato Late Blight Trial RAUDPC 20220224.xlsx` and `plotwise_values_new.csv`. It doesn't include the `VNIR Band Name and range.xlsx` data, as that is added later in the `MakeLong` function. 

The 2 different models are Partial Least Squares and Linear Regression. 
- Partial Least Squares: `Group3_PLS.Rmd`
- Linear Regression: `Group3.Rmd`
